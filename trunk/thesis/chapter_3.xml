    <title>ECMA 335</title>
    <para>In August 2000, while developing their new architecture known as .NET,
    Microsoft decided to submit the specification of the runtime engine and
    the new C# language to the European Computer Manufacturers' Association. These
    two elements of .NET were ratified by ECMA as ECMA standards 334
    <xref linkend="ecma-334"/> and 335<xref linkend="ecma-335"/> in December 2001;
    ECMA-334 describing the C# language and ECMA-335 describing the execution 
    environment.</para>
    <para>From the preface to ECMA-335:</para>
    
    <blockquote><para>
      This Standard ECMA-335 defines the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) 
      in which applications written in multiple high level languages may be 
      executed in different system environments without the need to rewrite 
      the application to take into consideration the unique characteristics 
      of those environments.</para>

    <title>Rotor</title>
    <para>The Shared Source Common Language Infrastructure, or 
    <firstterm>Rotor</firstterm>, is an implementation of ECMA 335 and 
    ECMA-335 in source form, released by Microsoft in 2002. Rotor contains 
    source code for a large set of libraries, tools and compilers, including
    the JIT compiler and the virtual machine.</para>
    
    <para>The source code for Rotor was derived from 
    Microsoft's commercial implementation of .NET, but forked and modified to 
    build and run on the Mac OS X and FreeBSD operating systems in addition to 
    Microsoft Windows. It is also easily portable to other operating systems
    and CPU architectures (it currently supports IA/32 and PowerPC CPUs). It 
    comes with a full implementation of the Base Class Library (BCL), but
    libraries outside the scope of the standard such as the ASP.NET web
    framework and the Windows Forms GUI toolkit are not included.</para> 
    
    <para>This text will henceforth use the terms <quote>Rotor</quote> and 
    <quote>SSCLI</quote> interchangeably.</para>
    
    <para>Rotor is provided under a so called <quote>Shared Source</quote> 
    license. This license prohibits any form of commercial use of the libraries
    and tools provided. The stated purpose of Rotor is to serve as an educational 
    tool, allowing academics to use it for research and teaching. It is also
    of great interest to advanced .NET programmers with an interest in what's 
    going on under the hood. The fact that it is so close to Microsoft's 
    commercial implementation makes it a perfect vehicle for gaining a deeper
    understanding of how .NET really works. For academic research it is also
    helpful to know that any modifications made to the SSCLI will most likely
    work on the commercial runtime. </para>
    
    <para>Rotor also contains source code for a C# compiler, implementing
    the ECMA-334<xref linkend="ecma-334"/> standard. The implementation
    of reference counting described in this text does not require compiler
    support, and the compiler will not be covered any further. A potential
    future expansion on the ideas presented here might also include direct
    language support (syntactic sugar) for reference counting, and it would 
    then be natural to use the Rotor C# compiler as a starting point.</para>

    <para>The SSCLI is a rather large piece of software (or perhaps a large 
    collection of smaller pieces of software). The unpacked tarball takes up 
    115 megabytes of disk space, consisting of 10808 files spread over a large
    number of directories. The execution engine is written in C++, with most 
    of the class library written in C#. There are also some assembler code 
    files.</para>

    important directories in the distribution.</para>

  <sect1 id="chapter_3-sect-4">
    <title>The SSCLI type system</title>
      <para> The CLR's type system reflects the fact that it is targetted
      primarily (but not exclusively) towards object-oriented languages. It
      supports two main categories of types:</para>
      <para>XXX: This section is taken a verbo from the generics essay</para>
      <variablelist>
          <varlistentry><term>objects</term>
              <listitem>Object types are always allocated on the heap. Any
              representation of an object as a local variable merely consists
              of a pointer to the object. In addition to the instance data, 
              an object also contains a pointer to a 
              <firstterm>method table</firstterm>(used for dispatching virtual
              methods) and a <firstterm>sync block.</firstterm>The latter is 
              used for thread synchronization, for example with the C# keyword
              <token>lock</token>. These two pointers give each allocated 
              heap object an overhead of 8 bytes(on a 32 bit platform).
              </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry><term>value types</term>
              <listitem>Value types are essentially nothing more than a
              sequence of bytes, and are represented as such on a program's
              stack. They are allocated either on the runtime
              stack or inline in objects that contain them. They support
              methods, but not inheritance, although they can implement 
              interfaces. Since the inheritance hierarchy is never more than one
              level deep, all method calls can be resolved at compile time and there
              is no need for a method table. Additionally, they do not have a 
              sync block, and cannot be used for thread synchronization(Technically,
              the compiler allows it, but you will merely end up boxing the value
              type into a freshly allocated anonymous object, which is completely
              useless). All primitive types, such as integers and
              floats, are represented in the CLR type system as value
              types. C#, for example, allows you to write this: 
              <programlisting>string s = 42.ToString();</programlisting></listitem>
          </varlistentry>
      </variablelist>
      
      <para>Since only objects are allocated dynamically, they are the only 
      types that are garbage collected, and thus of interest when implementing
      reference counting. Value types live either on the runtime stack or as 
      part of other objects, and their lifetimes are thereby already 
      deterministic.</para>
      
      <sect2>
        <title>Runtime representation of objects</title>
        <para>At runtime, objects are represented by the <classname>Object</classname>
        class, in <filename>clr/src/vm/object.h</filename>. This class has a 
        single field; a pointer to a <classname>MethodTable</classname> object:</para>
        
        <programlisting><![CDATA[
class Object
{
  protected:
    MethodTable    *m_pMethTab;
    
    // ... 
};    
    
        ]]>
        </programlisting>
        <para>Obviously, that's not the whole story. The <classname>Object</classname>
        class has a large number of methods, and there is a 
        <quote>hidden</quote> field associated with each object, located at a
        <emphasis>negative</emphasis> offset from the object itself:</para>

            </imageobject> 
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>
        
        <para>Every time an object is allocated, the <classname>ObjHeader</classname> is 
        allocated with it. If you have a pointer to an <classname>Object</classname>, you 
        can access the <classname>ObjHeader</classname> through some pointer trickery:
        </para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
ObjHeader   *GetHeader()
{
    return ((ObjHeader *) this) - 1;
}     
        ]]>
        </programlisting>
        
        <para>The <classname>ObjHeader</classname> is used for, among other things, 
        thread synchronization. The mechanism used here is worth noting, since 
        I have chosen a similar approach to implement reference counting.</para>
        
        <para>The <classname>MethodTable</classname> instance pointed to by 
        the sole member field of <classname>Object</classname> is shared among all 
        instances of a class. It determines the type identity of an object, i.e.,
        if <programlisting>obj1->p_methTab == obj2->p_methTab</programlisting>
        holds, the objects are of the same type.</para>
        
        <para>Further, it contains data and methods to acquire information about 
        the fields and methods associated with the type.</para>      
        
        <para><classname>MethodTable</classname> also contains a pointer to an 
        <classname>EEClass</classname> instance. Like <classname>MethodTable</classname>, 
        <classname>EEClass</classname> also contains information about types. There is a
        1-1 relationship between <classname>EEClass</classname> instances and 
        <classname>MethodTable</classname> instances; there is one of each for every type
        loaded. However, while <classname>MethodTable</classname> contains data and 
        operations that are designed to be accessed quickly at runtime, 
        <classname>EEClass</classname> contains the data that are typically only needed
        by compilers and other tools that need to be able to introspect into
        the type system. The separation between the two allow better cache
        coherency.</para>
